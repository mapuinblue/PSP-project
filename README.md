# Eventique-Final-Project
Personalized event calendar through which users can keep their daily routines or important events organized.

# Problem Description
In our daily lives, we constantly experience a sense of rush as more tasks, activities, and responsibilities accumulate each day. This often leads us to lose track of time, neglecting important obligations, which in many cases results in unpleasant consequences that could have been avoided with more efficient time management.

Many people struggle to keep up with their commitments, routines, and daily tasks due to the lack of an effective tool that helps them organize their time efficiently. While solutions like alarms exist, they cannot provide all the necessary information to ensure the successful completion of an event. Similarly, traditional paper agendas are outdated and lack the flexibility and reminder capabilities required in a digital world. It is in this context that the need arises for a web portal that allows users to keep track of their activities, receive reminders, and access calendars to better organize their lives.

# General Objective
To develop a customizable event calendar web portal using rigorous practices and agile methodologies that allow users to optimize their time management and commitments, following the planning and development guidelines established by PSP.

In addition to developing a web portal that allows event scheduling to meet organizational needs, the team adheres to agile software development practices and methodologies, ensuring a continuous improvement process.
